# WordMatrixHelper
Simple forms application that can work with MS Word equation editor matrices.

Matrices can be copied directly from Word and pasted into the two (top) operand text boxes.
The result can be copied back into the word equation editor, however to format the matrix properly right click the equation box and then click the 'Professional' option.
